## A system where:

**User 1** has a smartwatch that captures their environment and projects a holographic representation of **User 2**.

**User 2** can see **User 1's** environment through their AR glasses and control/interact with their own holographic representation in **User 1's** space in the real world.

## Two Devices:

**SmartWatch:**

- Equipped with sensors and cameras to capture the real-life environment.

- Act as a secondary input device that scans the environment and sends data to the AR glasses and central AR system.

**AR Glasses/Headset:**

- Function as the primary display for what the watch captures.

- Connect to the central AR system to receive holographic content and synchronization data.

- Incorporate sensors for tracking the user's movements.
