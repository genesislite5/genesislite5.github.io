## We intend to use a similar technology to Nreal Light’s AR Glasses:


Nreal Light employ SLAM technology with dual cameras to identify and track environment features, forming a 3D point cloud. This data, fused with IMU sensor readings via NRSDK, enables precise 6DoF positioning. Such 3D mapping facilitates tasks like plane detection for flat surface recognition.

**Nreal Light’s "birdbath optics" system projects a substantial virtual image via:**

> 1. Micro OLED Displays: These high-density panels ensure sharp visual output.

> 2. Mirrors: They reflect light internally, compacting the optical path.

> 3. Combiners: These semi-transparent elements merge reflected light, overlaying virtual images onto the real world.
