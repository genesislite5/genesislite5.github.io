**Headset:**
- Easier to make than glasses but uncomfortable, not convenient at all to just answer a call and put a huge headset on.

**Display Technology:**

- Waveguide-based optics or like OLED microdisplays integrated into the lenses or lens housings
High resolution and wide field of view `ideally close to human vision`
- Stereoscopic 3D rendering for accurate depth perception

**Computing Platform:**

- Processors or SoC solutions with dedicated GPU capabilities
- Integrated into the frame 

`Examples to look at: Qualcomm Snapdragon XR platforms or NVIDIA Jetson modules`

**Sensors and Tracking:**

- Inertial measurement units and cameras for head tracking and positional tracking
- Infrared sensors for gesture recognition and hologram control
- 6 degrees of freedom for positional tracking and head tracking
- Integrated into arms of the glasses

**Design:**

- Lightweight and comfortable materials like carbon fiber
- Balanced weight distribution 


### The Structure of the Glasses

**In the Lenses:**

- Waveguide-based optics 

**Frame:**

- `Front section` - Depth cameras or infrared sensors for gesture recognition and hologram control
- `Temple arms` - IMUs and cameras 

**Top or side sections:** 

- `Wireless connectivity`

**Temple Arms or Hinges:**

- Will accommodate the `computing platform`, including processors, memory modules (RAM and storage) and wireless communication modules 

**Battery and Cooling System:**

- `Batteries` or wireless power receivers could be integrated into the temple arms or frame
- Placed near the computing platform and other heat-generating components

**Audio System:**

- `Compact speakers` or bone conduction audio drivers could be integrated into the temple arms for audio output

**Input Controls:**

- Physical buttons or touch-sensitive surfaces could be incorporated for user input and control (though not a priority now)
