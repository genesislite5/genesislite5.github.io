AliceVision's Meshroom software for environmental capture. `currently testing in different lighting and environments using the camera on my phone`

AliceVision is a Photogrammetric Computer Vision Framework which provides 3D Reconstruction and Camera Tracking algorithms. AliceVision comes up with strong software basis and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms that can be tested, analyzed and reused. The project is a result of collaboration between academia and industry to provide cutting-edge algorithms with the robustness and the quality required for production usage. `according to their manual`

**Environmental Data Capture:**

- The depth-sensing cameras and RGB cameras on the smartwatch would capture a series of images or video frames of the user's environment from multiple angles 

- This captured data would be processed by Meshroom to generate a detailed 3D reconstruction of the environment.

**3D Reconstruction:**

- Meshroom uses Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo algorithms to reconstruct 3D geometry from the captured image or video data. 

- The software can detect and match features across multiple images and generate meshes and textured 3D models of the environment.

**Holographic Rendering:**

- This 3D environment can be integrated with the holographic rendering pipeline on the smartwatch or central server.

- This environmental data can be used to accurately position and render the holographic representation of the user within the captured environment.

**Real-time Updates and Optimization:**

- We are optimizing their code to have faster processing and updates as the user's environment changes.

- Maybe GPUs or offloading computationally intensive tasks to a central server or cloud infrastructure.
