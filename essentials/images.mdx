**Depth-Sensing Camera System:**

- A depth-sensing camera system capable of capturing high-resolution depth information in real-time.

- Use of technologies like structured light,infrared projector and camera or time-of-flight sensors.

- The depth-sensing camera system should have a wide field of view to capture the surroundings.
`Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect, or custom made systems using ToF sensors like from pmdtechnologies.`

**High-Resolution RGB Camera:**

- The watch should have a high-resolution RGB camera to capture detailed color and texture.

- Have a high frame rate 60 FPS or higher for smooth motion capture and minimal latency.

- Resolution should be at least 1080p or higher for capturing fine details and textures. Though this is not a priority now.
`Manufacturers from like Sony or OmniVision`

**Powerful Embedded Processor:**

- Need a processor to handle the computationally intensive tasks of depth and color data processing and 3D reconstruction

- Qualcomm Snapdragon or Samsung Exynos series that are designed for mobile devices

**ISP Image Signal Processor:**

- An ISP can offload some of the image processing tasks from the main CPU
Use of Integrated ISPs optimized for computer vision and image processing tasks.

**High Bandwidth Connection:**

- The watch will need to transmit a significant amount of data including depth, color, and potentially processed 3D data to the AR glasses and central AR system in real-time.


`Perhaps low-latency wireless technologies like 60GHz mmWave for minimal latency for the transmission of the holographic data.`

**Cooling System:**

- Intensive data transmission is probably going to generate significant heat, which will affect performance and battery life.
`We need an efficient cooling system, such as liquid cooling or openings.`

**Battery:**

The amount of data we have will drain the battery quickly.

- Will consider using a high-capacity battery or wireless charging.

**Components for modulating light:**

- DMD: Cheap, small form factors, low light efficiency (because using the diffraction lights), (binary phase patterns â†’ may need to change the phase retrieval algorithm to take into account) 

- MEMS: Totally different, for projectors and laser scanning systems.  Not holography technology. High light efficiency and also very compact (~2 mm diameter).
